# DMC5-EFX-Swapper
## Important note
I made this by looking at Darkness' efx.bt source code. Therefore it is likely that I missed/misinterpreted something. If you encounter any bugs please let me know on which efx file it occured.<br />
If the program says something like "File contains unsupported Segments", it either means that the file is corrupted or that it's not an efx file. <br />
I have not tested the program on other platforms except x64 windows.

## What this program does and how to use
It can add/remove existing effects or segments while incrementing/decrementing the effect counter/ segment counter of DMC5 efx files.<br />
**Library efx/segment:** The efx file you want to copy the effects/segments from.<br />
**Target/Installed efx/segment:** The efx file you want to change and save.
