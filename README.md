# DMC5-EFX-Swapper
## Important note
I made this by looking at DeepDankDarkness' efx.bt source code. Therefore it is likely that I missed/misinterpreted something. If you encounter any bugs please let me know on which efx file it occured.<br />
If the program says something like "File contains unsupported Segments", it either means that the file is corrupted or that there is an error in the prgoram. In any case please let me know and always check the saved file via 101 Editor. <br />
I have not tested the program on other platforms except x64 windows.

## What this program does and how to use
It can add/remove existing effects or segments while incrementing/decrementing the effect counter/ segment counter of DMC5 efx files.<br />
**Library efx/segment:** The efx file you want to copy the effects/segments from.<br />
**Target efx/segment:** The efx file you want to change and save.

## How to install
Just download the zip file of the repository, go to x64/Release and run the exe.
